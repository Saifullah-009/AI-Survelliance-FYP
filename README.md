# Advanced AI-Powered Object Tracking and Video Surveillance System

This project is my Final Year Project (FYP) for BS Artificial Intelligence at PAF-IAST. It is a real-time system that performs specific object detection, tracking, and GUI-based surveillance using YOLO.

## Features
- Real-time object detection (YOLO)
- Unique ID-based tracking 
- Speed and distance estimation
- User-selectable object tracking
- Snapshot and logging feature
- Tkinter-based user interface

## Tech Stack
- Python, OpenCV, Tkinter, Ultralytics YOLOv8, DeepSORT, DepthAI SDK
